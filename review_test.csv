We tried mexican in almost all the international cities but this is our first time in KL. Mexican food when we say, it should be spicy. So spicy that your eyes, nose, tongue should be burning. And the taste should b still on that u wont feel like stop eating. This is where la mexicana has barriers. Food is not at all spicy and tacos must be improved.Will I go there for a second time?

Everything started fine/beautifully and we were enjoying the well-spread & generous buffet. We arranged for a lucky draw & each of us was given a number and was excited looking forward to get a prize !Although we had requested from the hotel for a lucky draw 'bowl' and were promised one just a day before the gathering, we ended up picking the lucky draw winners from a small disposable plastic bag as they could not find an available bowl in the hotel. What a shame !When it was time to settle the bill, we had a rude shock as the "" not so friendly cum arrogant "" outlet manager (nicholas) insists we had 78 pax dining and not 72 pax > as according to our attendees' list and lucky draw numbers. We argued with him in front of other guests and had even requested to view the CCTV but he was adamant and further ""humiliate"" us by saying he did not count 2 more pax which were inside the toilet. If that is the case, why didn't this manager charged 80 pax as we have yet to settle the bill then ?If you look at the number 80 compared to 72, that is a huge 10% difference ! How did he arrive at this figure ? We pay what we ought to pay, nothing more nothing less ! It is just a matter of principle.But to avoid further embarrassment, we decided to pay under 'protest'. To us, this is like ""daylight robbery"" and imagine, it happened right inside a so-called 5-star hotel !Perhaps, a more service-oriented manager with good PR would have settled this matter amicably and in a professional manner, instead of being ""high-handed"", bossy & humiliate hotel guests openly ?As such, we have decided against holding anymore event in the future at this hotel.",Reviewed 21 December 2016 ,Warisan Cafe,KL,Seafood
2976024166,"dexter1881Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Popular bistro but lacklustre service,"We (with 2 toddlers) walked in at around 6:45PM on a rainy Sunday evening for dinner, at that time there were no patrons except us. The restaurant manager, who hid himself behind the bar counter, was rather laid back even when I jokingly asked for a bath towel/apron to get ourselves dried up from the rain. Other waitresses were a touch friendlier, offering white napkins that unfortunately didn‚Äôt help much due to their highly slippery polyester texture.The complimentary breads came in a few variety, all were freshly and beautifully delivered. The butter set in porcelain dish was too cold/solid coming straight from the fridge. It could be served with a bit of pre-warming up. Our appetiser, escargot/mushroom on brioche, was nicely and tastefully prepared. Even the kids loved this dish. The main courses were not so remarkable. Whilst the chef recommended duck confit with ‚Äúso-so‚Äù foie gras tasted fine, the chicken roulade was downright forgettable. Serving portions were on the generous side, so there is a good sense of value for money here.Several wines were made available by the glass. The C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne that I picked not only held up very well as a standalone wine, but it also matched very well with the duck confit dishes.When our dinner was over at around 8PM, all the restaurant tables were fully packed. After paying the bill at the cashier counter near the entrance/exit, none of the staffs bothered to open the folding door for us even when we were having difficulty to exit the stepped door with toddlers in strollers. Instead, a gracious patron (Westerner) seated near the folding door got up from his seat and helped us with the exit.YEAST seems to have all the right elements to differentiate itself from the rest of the eateries around Bangsar area, but its service department clearly needs to be revamped to be sustainable for long term business.

The prawn roll rocks and the orh nee is not overly sweet and you will not feel sick eating too much of it.This is the part where it will contradict some of the reviews here that have some complaints about their service.The same lady asked where we were going after our meal and we mentioned about walking to Jonker st.

It is that good! No joke! One may find its odd corner location and super simple setting strange. But don't let its down-to-earth appearance change your mind. Just find a place and relax.The menu offers the typical tandoor stuff (chicken n various nann breads and etc), rogan lamb, seafood curries and quite extensive vegetarian choices. It also offers (veg n non-veg) tali sets during weekday lunch time. But its best dishes are the briyani rice. I have to say the fish version is the best. And it us not often to see fish briyani on the menu unless it's a specialist shop. We also love its kerala paratha, which we don't often see in other restaurants too. I have to say this place does it the best among all the versions I have tried, including the ones from a famous Kerala specialty restaurant. (Should I name it here?!) I can confidently say that we have tried just about almost all dishes, perhaps except for the vegetarians. It is very difficult to find one we won't try again. Now, the service is plan amazing! The long time servers know their stuff. They can recommend the right dishes according to your liking and choices. Very rarely anything goes wrong, and if they accidentally do so, they make it up to the customers immediately without a second word. We have become friends with the friendly crew here over the years.

Pizza was ok and chicken quite below average with a very poor sauce. It was so poor that we could not be sure if it was intended for the chicken or the side salad. The warm bread was actually nicer than the chicken. No one asked us how the food was so I guess the chef is not interested. After serving us, no one asked if we want to order anything else. Also, another surprise. The ambience was ordinary and I had to sit facing some big equipment. No music, making the ambience even more dull. Their saving grace is their very polite staff and general hygiene.We reserved by phone directly to the restaurant at around 5pm but when we arrived, our reservation was not found. That was disturbing and probably the reason I got a machine facing seat.During phone reservation, the staff asked if it‚Äôs a special occasion and I said ‚Äòit‚Äôs my birthday‚Äô. I have seen in previous reviews and there is complimentary birthday cake given to other guests. I did not get any cake. The staff serving also asked if any special occasion and I said ‚Äòbirthday‚Äô and if there was any promotion for birthday. He said he will check and came back to say there was none. It sounds odd that some guests get recognized and some ignored. Not sure what is the discrimination policy here. Would it really hurt their pockets that much to give a tiny piece of cake or tart or macaroon? It‚Äôs just a small personal touch. Also odd that I am asked twice about special occasion yet it means nothing, causing me to believe more of being discriminated. Maybe because we are not big spenders as we don‚Äôt eat beef or drink alcohol.

8181432076,Kaycci S,Needs a Wake Up Call and NOW,"The idea of a rotating restaurant is exciting but this execution was poor. We (a group of 4) went for afternoon tea as we had just missed the lunch buffet session. The lady doing the reservations at the bottom though, couldn't stress the fact that it was a very light meal more (almost like a warning). From the observation deck, we needed to walk up a set of stairs to reach the restaurant. The doors for the stairs though were the fire safety doors, the ones that are designed to be heavy and should be closed after you walk through them - but it was held open by a chair and hence defeats the safety purpose of it. The thing that really annoyed me about the stairs was the fact that it felt like walking at the back alley dodgy part of town - there wasn't a clear indication that the door we walked to was the one to the restaurant. And when we did open the door, we were greeted with cleaning supplies right in front of us. The decor is beyond old. It needs a facelift, new wallpaper. The colours make the dining room seem unclean (browns, dirty looking oranges and greys). The carpet seemed as if it hadn't been cleaned in over 20 years - very dirty coloured. It was also a tripping hazard as I found myself tripping a few times and even saw some of the workers stumbling as well. Don't believe in all the pictures of it looking nice and pretty, in the day it was extremely dull and lifeless. The worst part of the restaurant is the restroom. I needed to go use the restroom and found it extremely uncomfortable that one of the employees literally just stands in that room. I opened the door and she was standing right at the door (so close that I almost pushed the door right into her). There was no music or anything in the restroom, and it was extremely uncomfortable as she was basically listening to me use the toilet. There is a range of cakes, some samosas (and various other things along the lines of it) and noodle soups. Our table sampled most of the cakes that were available and I was heavily disappointed in them. Out of all the cakes we had, only a couple were nice. The others were uninspiring and dull. The sandwiches were pathetic - afternoon tea sandwiches are not just a kraft single slices in slices of bread. I understand that food in novelty things such as this are usually not breath-taking, but reading other reviews I thought there was hope. To future visitors, be warned - it is not great food.Also, ignore the so called dress code. If you read online they want you to dress appropriately for the 'beautiful environment' they have created, but you don't need to follow it. Just dress however you want because they don't enforce it. Also, if I dressed to match their 'beautiful environment' I would have worn my sweat pants.The one real positive thing I can say though is that the waiters are attentive. They will refill you water regularly and clear you plates as well.The rating of 2 is only due to the price. Had it been more expensive, it would be a 1 rating.

3851659300,"ZyenPetaling Jaya, Selangor",Two star service in a six star hotel,"My friend and I happened to be in Royale Chulan for an event, and we decided to have an early dinner at Warisan Cafe which is in the hotel.When we arrived, we wanted to sit at a table which had a couch instead of at the table with chairs; however the two tables that were still available hadn‚Äôt even been cleaned up yet. So we had to take a table which had chairs instead.We had to wait for a while before my friend finally flagged someone for the menu. Mind you, it‚Äôs not that they were unaware that we were there; a waitress had tried to direct us to the standalone table before we attempted to take the table with the couch.And even so, we found that the staff were more focused on cleaning up the two tables that we initially took a look at, instead of handing us the menu.We placed our order, and then waited for our early dinner to arrive. It took a really long time. I didn‚Äôt actually check the time because for once I wasn‚Äôt wearing my watch, but think it was more than 20 minutes before our food arrived.My friend had ordered tenderloin steak, whereas I ordered the rack of lamb. And as we picked up our fork, we suddenly realised that it was only accompanied with a spoon and a butter knife.My friend hailed the head waiter and all she did was hold up the butter knife and gave him a look. Fortunately he did know what she was referring to, because he promptly called a waitress to get steak knives. I couldn‚Äôt really hear what he said, but there was something about ‚Äúif they are not at the back, get them from‚Ä¶‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt make out where.And it was another five minutes before the waitress appeared through the front door (she had gone out through a side door) with two steak knives. By then I had eaten all my accompanying vegetables and mashed potatoes as I had been pretty hungry.The food was not excellent. I would say that the quality is acceptable, but not excellent. It is typical of restaurants within hotels to charge high prices, but normally the food quality would also match the price. I have honestly had much better food at five-star restaurants at a fraction of the price.My friend‚Äôs steak was still very raw although she asked for medium. Halfway through, she sent the steak back for further cooking, and when it came back, it was not much better. My friend told me, ‚ÄúSix star hotels would usually rearrange the vegetables on the plate to make it look nice.‚Äù That‚Äôs based on her experiences of six star hotels. Her plate came back looking the same way she sent it back. Personally though, I‚Äôd probably prefer it that way because it means no one (theoretically) touched my food.After we ate, my friend called for the bill, and we waited for five minutes in vain, so we flagged another waiter for the bill, who said that the bill was on the way. We again had to wait for another five minutes for our change. The waiter who returned the change explained that their ‚Äúsystem was down‚Äù.That hardly explains why the service was so shoddy. This is not to say that the service staff were not polite. They are polite as most staff are in the service industry. It was just not six star service. The price and star rating hardly justified the service we got.I think the only people who would eat there are hotel guests, or like in our case, are already there and just need something to eat. I would certainly not bother to go out of my way to this restaurant in this hotel for a meal.

WRONG!!! they are one of the few that rip you off blind, with these prices its better to have quality food in a more hygienic set-up across the Causeway. At least if you were to get hit by food poisoning in Singapore for sure the authorities will do something about it. I was there last year and the occasion was on the contrary memorable. I was working out of JB and a consultant partner of mine was looking to have a good steak dinner so i thought of treating her to a better restaurant and boy was i wrong. First up cockroaches running everywhere, once we sat down and water was not even served there was this little critter crawling up the side of our table. The girl that was passing the menus came we pointed at the critter she smiled used her hand to sweep it to the floor and swiftly placed a foot to it and picked it up and left. Next up more cockroaches, there was one hiding in my cutlery set, which I had to make not once but 2 requests to have my knife and fork changed after the ordeal. The service crew are more interested to ask you stupid questions at the wrong time. Clearly i was unhappy for the cockroach incident so please change my table to your best roach free one and not come almost every eight mins or so asking me on how are things and inquiring on the taste of my food. How many times must a customer indicate that they are not happy with his dinner to get some attention? The servers seem to be all former Makati, Jollibee recruits. They are trained like robots selling fried chicken with one style and one sauce only, even if there was a fire or earthquake during service that night their modus operandi would remain the same, even if the Pope himself would have arrived that night for dinner it would have been the same or even if the Pope would have died whilst mid eating there that night it would be even more the same. The place is dimly lit that gives that horror feeling even more, not knowing if that piece of what looks like black olive you are placing in your mouth is food at all. I had an even funnier incident with this restaurant during Christmas eve dinner where I was unsuspecting lead to believe when i was told by a close friend that we were going to one of the best steak house across the Tebrau Straits for dinner. Just shows why i say fast food service or call centre staff should never be asked to take care of finer food serving establishments.

Usually in other Nando's restaurants they will take about 15 minutes tops and this is when it is filled with customers. But I waited for almost half an hour just to get the change. I had to go to the cashier and I see a long queue of people. The young man was operating the cash register and I finally see why it took so long. He was laughing and talking to his friend inside the kitchen. You can laugh and talk while your hand is working but he literally stopped to talk to his friend. I got angry and asked him to hurry. No appologies from the waiter as he just asked which table I sat on. I showed him and he gave me a new bill. I immediately raised my voice saying I have paid and was waiting freaking half and hour just to get my change. He immediately try to find the former bill along with my money that he stacked with other bills (a stack means around 10 bills unattended).

Menu is extensive enough for appetizers (2 of them can make a completely filling meal) if not go for the main course. Beautiful selection of wines.

The cafe is all in length so as we walked in, it looked bigger and bigger! Quite surprising. There was a band so we thought: how nice...unfortunately the nicest area was a smoking area and we had to be closer to the entrance and far from the action to enjoy a smoking free area. There was a huge board at the entrance with the special food written on but non visible from anywhere in the restaurant unless you walked to the entrance to view it. None of the described food appear on any menu so we did not know and did not order what we would have otherwise. I ordered a moussaka and my husband Pad Thai. My moussaka was made of potatoes and eggplant covered with a thick layer of cheese and a nice creamy sauce BUT it was served with French fries and a salad. Why serve a dish that already contains potatoes with additional potatoes??? Moreover you could taste they were made from frozen potatoes and were dry and overcooked. The salad was made of mainly greens with very little dressing on it. When we tried to get the attention of the waiter he seemed uninterested and just wanted to walk away! The Pad Thai came black!!! Taste was so-so...Since we don't eat meat we asked the waiter to remove the chicken and he suggested to replace the chicken with either salmon or prawns and we agreed. It came with nothing. He had to ask for extra bean sprouts or else the dish was almost with nothing in it for RM29!!! All in all a very disappointing evening. Couldn't really hear the band, smell of cigarettes smoke permeated the entire place, special food not visible from anywhere. We each had a beer - Guinness for my husband and Hoogarden for me.

They took out the sashimi and the foie gras and put in place a display of boring salads from Rumania, a country with no culinary tradition and nothing of interest. The buffet was adorned with brochures from some Rumanian product, which I found improper. Evidently someone had paid the Ritz to display whatever they were trying to sell. The seafood was insipid. The oysters were kind of okay. There was a very poor variety. The beef roast was excellent but the lamb leg not really great, although they had a delicious foie gras sauce. There were no drinks included in the buffet. Just ice water. The price was about 50 USD per person all included, which on Malaysia was too much for not too good quality. I was not impressed.

I personally feel they are getting very orverpriced and nothing really extra ordinary about their sashimi, except when they feature their latest ingredient for the month. However, they have a wide range of ochas to choose from. I love their ochas, but not their food. The udon selection is very limited too, and the soup is inconsistent. At times the flavors are well balanced, at times, over salty. Sushi rice sometimes are so well made that you know the sushi chef is in a very good mood that day, and some other times the rice just fell apart when I was about to pick it up.

The food arrived around 15 min after we ordered. The food turn out fine. Definitely a little more than average but not quite hit the wonderful button. We wanted to try out the cakes and had called up the service to check out the menu for their cakes but sadly they don't have one. Given that our seats is upstairs and i wore heel that time, we both just decided on our selection based on our glimpse earlier.The cake was a Ok but still not quite hitting the great level.

We eventually got our bill rectified (so kudos on that).What made our blood boil was that the server was mumbling loudly at the other side of the restaurant about how we wouldn't have ordered small to share.

Imagine my disappointment this round, that not only the price per person has increased from around RM150 per head (after tax) to RM180, they also had certain items which are limited.Upon arriving at 12pm (buffet was from 12-230), we were ushered into a crowded dining area and were told that the Chutoro (tuna belly) was limited to 3pc per person and oysters was limited to only 2pcs per person. On top of the fact that the premium items were already limited, the food was incredibly insufficient for the diners. By 12.30pm, the Unagi (I saw 20 thumb size pcs when I was seated at 12.05pm) were long gone and not replenished, so was the shishamo, the tempura prawns, the ameabi, and most of the small appetisers. The food display remained relatively empty throughout. By 1:30pm I actually asked one of the servers if they were ever going to replenish the unagi since I didn't get some, the staff went to the back and came back with 6 tiny thumb size portions.....and proceeded to put on the display counter and brought an additional 2 pcs for me. I mean....it was very crowded that day....i even saw people literally running to the counter to grab it....at RM180 per head, that's an insult.The service staff were efficient in serving the customers, but they had no control of the amount of food coming out of the kitchen. They were all nice except for the manager who, perhaps know he will have to listen to many customer complaints kept disappearing.

The staff used to be friendly and provided good service as well. However, there seems to be a grave concern in the way the kitchen is functioning in this place. Yesterday I visited this place for lunch with a friend and being a vegetarian, I ordered the dishes I usually did here - Garlic Naan, Puri, Aloo bhojpuri, and a Paneer dish. We were almost done eating, when we were shocked to find a piece of meat in the vegetarian Aloo bhojpuri dish. We brought this to the notice of the staff, who immediately took the piece of meat with them, took it to the kitchen to talk to the cook I guess, then came back and apologised. We were so appalled by what had happened, however the damage was done and there was nothing that could be done to undo or reverse it. The damage control they tried to do was, they dint charge us for that ONE dish, but made us pay for the rest of the food. I am vegetarian for personal reasons, but can one imagine what would have happened to someone who was allergic to certain foods and the dietary requests were not implemented and they ended up in the hospital ?! If people were vegetarian for religious reasons, consuming meat like this would be a major transgression and offensive to their faith. This restaurant says they are halal, but who knows what is being done in the kitchen and what the customers are being served ? Who knows how many times this may have happened in the past and gone unnoticed by the patrons, especially since one cannot even see what they are being served or what they are eating considering the dim lighting in the evenings in this place. I will never visit this place again, since my trust in them is completely destroyed. Kitchen sanitation and food separation is so important in the restaurant business since customers place their blind trust that the food they are being served is clean and authentic (it should be what they say it is, for example, vegetarian or halal or sea-food free etc), and customers have no way of verifying it first hand.

3873575486,juz_do_itKuala Lumpur,"The pork ribs were nice, lovely, thick bones","For the world of me, I cannot understand why oh why so many restaurant operators place sooooo much priority on their restaurant ambience and decor instead of the food they serve. Walking in, the restaurant looked like a nice hang out place....it is - over a couple of glasses of beer. We specifically came for the pork ribs.....you know, pork ribs with succulent and tender rib meat which has the right meat to bone ratio. The first to be served were the German Pepper Sausage (RM19++). Instantly, we were dismayed at the portion size. As we weren't into sauerkraut, they asked could they just give us more mash potatoes to which we said yes please. Well, the sausages with the so called 'extra' serving of mash potatoes were a totally unimpressive.Next came the Half rack of Pork Ribs (RM38++). I do boil 'pai kut tng' (pork ribs soup) at home and all I can say is that if I was blur enough to pay for pork ribs with the meat cut so close to the bones, I definitely deserve to hear this comment, ""You don't know how to choose more meaty ribs meh??""Of course my lunch partner and I were commenting, ""OMG, so little meat."" There was no salad or any sides that came with the pork ribs. Such a pity - taste wise, they got the sauce right. Well, the BBQ ribs came with nice, lovely, thick bones.This is yet another time where we were thankful we didn't order more dishes. Among the meats, pork is the cheapest in Malaysia. I buy only 1 kg of pork ribs at the market each time and I can get meaty cartilage ribs so I can't understand why chefs at restaurants supposedly specializing in BBQ pork ribs serve pork ribs with so little meat. Another thing, some of the reviewers have been too generous to this restaurant. No one commented about the portion size of their dishes or in this case, ribs being their specialty, the meat to bone ratio.With one pint of Tiger beer (RM19++) the damage for this lunch was RM87.45. Makes one wonder how so many Japanese buffet restaurants in Klang Valley make money when such a high proportion of their menu items are imported.

(Wow, does he need to control which table number we have to be seated)It was too far away from the food counter and there were several empty seats in the middle (i saw a 4 seater table with 2 person seated just now), so i would much prefer to sit in the middle. He then said, he expected crowd and he need to optimize their seatings. (FYI, there were lots of empty seats at that hour). And so my husband told him, it was already after lunch time. He‚Äôs replied back this way: ‚ÄúJust now i told you to sit at the 2 table seat and you don‚Äôt want, so i told you to sit at the back 4 seater seat and then now you said you want to sit in the middle..Does that mean, we can‚Äôt choose where to sit when we paid for our food?

2451302113,"PappanMajumdarKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",A RM 560 lunch which did not deliver...,"Overall it didn't deliver for us family of 4 - 2 adults and 2 children (15 and 8). We went to celebrate my elder daughter's high score in an exam. We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Location - situated in a remote area of Ampang. We traveled 17 kms from Mont Kiara. We checked out the overall review on TA and this place was highly recommended. My first complaint is that there is no signage at the entrance of the restaurant. You end up at a place where the road is a dead end and without a signage you wonder whether you have landed at the right place because there is nobody to ask there as it is quite isolated. Decor - Very nicely done. A lovely pathway leading to the restaurant area with a lovely pond with many tortoises outside (a good hit with children for sure). It is mainly wooden construction and is open from all sides, overlooking lush green forest and green area. You could have a nice walk about near the restaurant. Interiors are pretty straightforward. What did not deliver for us is the heat and humidity of a KL sunny afternoon. It gets a bit uncomfortable. And the restaurant should have air con to manage this I feel. If your day is bad and it is hot and sunny in KL, trust me you will not enjoy the temperature at the restaurant. They have kept it natural which is a problem as per me. On the other hand, if it is raining and a little cooler then it could be a nice experience. But a restaurant needs to deliver either ways, isn't it? And not leave it to chance.Service. Many issues. The staff just seems to be doing their job because they have to do it. They are really not happy doing it. Nor are they really keen to give service with a smile and pay that extra attention. Also, they keep making a disappearing act from the deck area and many a times you are just waiting for one of them to grace the occasion. Service matters later on because of the value for money equation. I will come to that later. Food. They have a fixed Sunday lunch menu. Firstly, there is a timing for that. The last order is taken at 2.30 pm. So, please watch out for that. Because we landed at 1.30 pm and by the time you settle down and try to order it is already 2 pm and then you have to start getting worried about putting in every order by 2.30 pm. Also, one of the staff an old gentleman kind of came and gave a look of ""yeh better order food fast or else you get nothing"" which did not help at all. SO, PLEASE ENSURE YOU GET THE TIMING RIGHT. For a 2.30 pm last order, you need to be there latest by 1 pm. Better would be 12.30 pm because they do take their time to serve the food.So, it is fixed menu. RM 180 for adults with free flowing wine. RM 120 for children above 12, 50% for below 12 years. You can order all you want. The choice is extensive between seafood, poultry, beef, duck, starters, desserts. No problem with that. But the staff here reluctantly or hesitatingly explain to you that you can order as much as possible. So, you have to kind of discover what exactly is the system here. Well, that is still acceptable. But, what they don't explain or recommend is the portion which are abysmally small. Really, the starters are literally 1 piece offering. So, the least the staff could do is to recommend that this much is good enough to order. And in a situation where you are racing against time and that elderly gentleman sneering about the time, all this doesn't help. Even the ""free flowing"" wine is served slowly reluctantly. Every time you have to call the waiter to refill the wine. Why, if you are saying free flowing, then why can't you make it so? The restaurant should train the staff to keep an eye when the wine is getting over and refill generously. Food quality and taste is average. What is amusing is that the food served is mostly cold!! How can that be? Firstly you have a deadline on ordering which you are racing to fulfill and when you do that well within time, you are still served cold food??!! Really??!!Finally the bill. RM 561. Definitely on the higher side. That is fine. But what it delivers is quite poor. First, the location...everybody goes gaga with the forest kind of feel. Which is agreed. But for us Indians who have traveled extensively in remote areas in India, this kind of place is nothing extra ordinary. Secondly, the service is quite poor. Thirdly, the food portion and the fact that it is served cold. There is no excuse for this. Finally, the nail in the coffin is the value for money delivery is poor - nothing more. So, my advise is that KL which is the land of food and with over 4000 restaurants on TA available, do you want to go spend more than RM 500 on this kind of an experience? I leave the decision to you.Some other points to make. We made a reservation through Table App which holds good. But on reaching most of the restaurant was empty anyways. Sunday afternoon, we thought it should have been a bit better. Some of the seating overlooking the forest has a problem - there are big black ants which keep visiting the bench seating.

3355754122,"Mikkie LCosta Mesa, California","Great decor, bad service","This place was just across my hotel and I decided to walk-in for an afternoon meal on Christmas Day. I had a bad experience with their service. Walking in, the place looked really great, the design and the majority of the chairs looked amazing. I was immediately seated and given a menu. I ordered a kebab and a sprite. When my server took my menu, his exact words were, ""soup or salad?"" as if it were included in my meal. I was a little surprised by this question because I didn't think anything was included, I thought they were doing a Christmas Day special of sorts. My drink came out promptly, the soup was brought 8 minutes after ordering. The actual entree took more than 25 minutes! During this time there were 4-5 other groups eating. I was looking around for someone's attention because I wanted another drink. There were at least 5 servers working but they were gathered around each other and just talking. After I finished my meal I waited around to see how long it would take someone to notice and give me my check. Took 10 minutes before I had to get up and ask someone for my bill. I expected to pay RM 25 for my drink and kebab entree, I was pleasantly surprised with the extra RM 10 that was in the check for that goddamn mushroom soup I didn't even want. I told the server, that he didn't tell me that the soup was an extra charge. I guess that's just one of the ways they scam you here.The service was terribly ridiculous as there was no one else at the restaurant by the time I was finished eating. Not to mention, a lady was mopping the floor of the entire restaurant while I was eating, went around me too. I don't want to seem rude, but when you're having a meal on Christmas Day, a dirty mop is not something you'd like to look at while you put food in your mouth.

4285385386,stormlccIpoh,Master the Basics Before Doing Your Own Thing,"I love Italian food, I also love Japanese food. However I have my reservations for ""fusion"" food such what this restaurant has to offer. You see, a lot of fusion restaurants tend to incorporate more than one kind of cooking into their dishes without first mastering the basics of one particular cooking style. This tends to make the taste of their food out of balance and balance is what separate the good from the bad, or in this case, the good from the great.Lets get one thing straight off the bat, some of the dishes (at least the ones that I have tasted so far) in this place is above average compared to other places in Ipoh, and IT SERVES PORK which to me says ""the chef has some balls! and integrity"" because it is very very difficult to survive (in the F&B industry) in Ipoh if you are not giving 2 hoots to our Malay friends. Many many entrepreneurs who opened restaurants that serves pork in this place closed shop because they were unable to serve the 30% Malay population (at least) thus loosing potentially 1/3 of business revenue. And I love pork. For me, if you are not serving pork in a so called ""Japanese"" or ""Italian"" restaurant you DON'T DESERVE to be called that because pork is the soul of the food of these 2 great nations.Now comes the specific (personal) analysis of the dishes that my group ordered. Firstly the appetizers, the Caesar salad with bruschettas and mushroom soup. The dressing of the salad is spot on, very nice and not overly dressed. To me it is the perfect salad. But it comes with 2 bruschettas and one of them is the ota-ota flavoured. Seriously...ota-ota? If you want to do something different just for the sake of doing something different, DON'T. It RUINED the whole salad dish. What did I say about balance of flavours (this sentence will repeat very often in this review)? First you serve me a fresh, well dressed and very refreshing salad and then you expect to tingle my senses by that ota-ota? Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike ota-ota, I like it on it's own, but not with a perfect Caesar salad. On the other hand, the mushroom soup just tasted like any regular mushroom soup that's was in a package from a Tesco.Then I had my ""Classic Carbonara"" which is quite confusing because there is NOTHING CLASSIC about this dish. When it arrived I found some bonito flakes on top albeit a very tiny amount shaved very thinly, you would hardly notice them if you do not cook any Japanese dishes. I do, so they are very obvious to me. Ok then, it's NOT Classic in any way, they should name it ""Fusion Carbonara"" instead. This is just nitpicking in the name and I apologize to waste your time. The question is: WHY? Is it to enhance the flavour of the dish? You can't, not with this tiny amount. Is it to enhance the presentation? You also can't, not with this tiny amount shaved this thin you can hardly notice them. So what's the point? Please be reminded that this is a pasta dish that consist of at least 30% cheese in it, so any subtle ingredients in small amount will just be wasted. The fundamental basics of how to make a good carbonara is the balanced mix of good cheese, good eggs and parsley to accentuate the richness of these 3 core ingredients. The cheese is there for the richness. The eggs are there to combine all the elements, to soften the taste of the cheese a bit and also to make the sauce smoother and runnier. The parsley (which a lot of people ignore and is more important than you think) is there to provide balance of flavours between the 3 core ingredients, to lessen the blow of the cheese - egg mixture and to provide colouring to the whole dish. I am disappointing to say that the parsley was not there in this dish. This caused it to look bland, and too rich because they put too much cheese in the mixture and the balance is totally out.There's the 'Pasta with Bacon and Cherry Tomatoes' that my wife ordered. Most of the time this combination of bacon and cherry tomatoes is perfect. You have flavourful smoky bacon and you have slightly stir fried sweet sweet cherry tomatoes, how can you top that? By adding in long beans? NO! Usually long beans are great if they are the main ingredient but in this case, they are just SOME ingredient they chef put in there to be different. If this pasta is called 'Pasta with Long Beans (with bacon & tomatoes)' with long beans as the core of the dish then it will be great. It's also the way they cooked the long beans. They have been very slightly stir fried to make them look fresh and light green. Good if it's on it's own, bad if mixed with other subtle ingredients. This is a grave error in this particular dish because the their smell covers the entire dish. We had a pasta that only taste like under-cooked long beans with a slight hint of bacon and tomatoes. It's like the rookie's error of under cooking bell peppers for a pasta dish, the whole thing will just taste like raw vege.I almost forgot to mention the pasta itself. If you know how to make fresh pasta yourself it wouldn't be anything special but if you don't (not interested, lazy etc.) then it is something worthwhile to try it out in this place.We also ordered the Sakura Pork which tasted quite amazing. It very juicy and tender with good flavour and reminds me of freshly roasted Chinese pork with a pineapple sauce. Speaking of pineapple sauce, this sauce is the highlight of the day. The balance is spot on, the flavour is incredible and it compliments the pork perfectly.Then comes the dessert. I am not THAT into sweet stuff, but some of the options here are quite good. The Chocolate Mousse is GREAT, it's got a hint of bitterness to it which I love and it actually tasted like Belgium Chocolate and the Creme Brulee was not bad (which is high praises from me). But the Semifreddo is not my cup of tea. The Tiramisu is quite acceptable except for the taste of alcohol was too strong, balance of taste is not up to par here but I applaud the chef for using alcohol, at least it's made the correct way and it's really home made. There are just too many shops in this country selling disgusting feces and they dare to name them Tiramisu without a hint of alcohol in them and then charge a fortune to rip people off. This place is NOT one of them.I also want to mention the environment. There's no denying it, it's quite nice and cozy because the place is so small. The decorations are kept at a minimal but everything is clean and very inviting. The only issue we had is the weather of Malaysia and El Nino. On that evening we are experiencing super high heat, and the 3 tiny 1-2hp air-con units in the dining room were unable to keep up with. They should have installed 2 units of 5hp air-con but due to (presumably) their inexperience in running their own business they opt to save cost in buying 3 units of small air-con. I pity them because in the long run, their electricity bills will stack up like mad, since small air-cons uses so much more juice when they are running at full capacity compared to big ones running at low in the same environment.The conclusion is this restaurant can do better and has huge potential if the chef can adjust his style a bit and improve on his basics.

In order to secure a corner table, which we always preferred, I went to the restaurant one day earlier to make my reservation and specified which table we wanted. The waiter wrote down our preferred table and confirmed it. A staff called me in the afternoon the next day to reconfirm my reservation. I confirmed it, and again stressed that we wanted the table which I specified earlier.When we arrived, much to our disappointment, the table we booked for was occupied! I don't understand how, after going through such length to reserve the table we wanted, it was given away freely! It was Valentine's Day (and this was not an excuse really), so we didn't start off the evening very well . Thanks to these forgetful and 'don't-care' attitude of those individuals, we had to make do with a table next to the kitchen, which was warm and I was perspiring throughout. Didn't have a choice as that was the only corner table left. And there wasn't a single apology from the staff.To quench our thirst, we wanted 2 glasses of warm water, to which the staff explained that 'the pipe was faulty', thus we have to purchase imported bottled water that were placed on our table. What coincidence and how convenient.Food and beverage was generally good and service was fast. My wife ordered the Angelo Special mocktail, which was 'so-so' and I had Chianti. The beverages arrived within 3 mins. The starters we ordered, a bowl of mushroom soup and antipasto, arrived within 6 mins. Mushroom soup was a slightly bland, however the antipasto was very tasty. We loved the fact that it has so many choices on our plate.For main course, my wife ordered gnocchi and I had the hotplate Seafood Marinara. The Seafood Marinara was tasty. That was pretty much a highlight for me. Generous in portion, the dish came with mussels, clams, squid and prawns. Pasta was al dente, while the sauce tasted good and lightly spiced. Recommended. The gnocchi on the other hand was hard to eat. The pasta wasn't well-textured, which was a pity as the sauce was rather tasty. Our total damage was just below RM200.Overall, we liked the operational and kitchen's ability to provide fast service. General ambience of the restaurant was good enough for a date.

It was recommended to us by a friend and we were very impressed at first when we arrived. The place was beautiful and had a very romantic feel to it (just what we were hoping for as it was our anniversary). We had booked several days before through their online booking system and received confirmation as well so we were shocked to find out that we weren't even on the list for the night unless you count my boyfriend's name scribbled on a random paper next to it, which we had to point out to them. The host looked unconvinced (and confused) we actually had a booking and showed us a table anyway--I guess lucky for us the place didn't look to busy otherwise we wouldn't have gotten in. The service was alright at first but somehow didn't feel like we were getting the service we want. Mind you, we're not expecting them to wait for us hand and foot, but we do like to order when we're ready, have the staff ask us how we're doing occasionally, and ask if we needed anything every now and then. It was hard to get their attention most of the time and we can't help feel we were being ignored because we didn't have a proper reservation (even though we did). I guess we could have let things slide except at the end of the dinner, my boyfriend revealed that he guessed that they forgot about the special surprise he had planned. Apparently he had emailed them asking if they could organise a complimentary dessert that says ""Happy Anniversary"" on it to mark the occasion. He even showed me the email where they stated they were going to inform the restaurant about the dessert. We waited for it for a long time but nothing came. We thought about saying something about it but the moment passed and the dinner felt ruined already. Didn't want to force them to make us something they should have done already. Made us a bit jealous because the couple next to us got a dessert that says ""Happy Holidays"" on it, which made us wonder if it was meant for us. Who knows...?

That is why I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1. My experiences there are on after-dinner get togethers on Saturday nights and so I will comment on them. On the plus side, I think that it can suit a variety of people's tastes because it has a food and drink section downstairs and a clubbing area upstairs. You don't have to be stuck in the clubbing area if clubbing is not your thing, unless you get dragged into it by your tipsy friends! The ambience downstairs is relatively nicer than upstairs. Don't mistake the downstairs area will be a relaxing place for a catch up because the music from upstairs will get blasted at some point in the night, so you'd have to shout to the person you're talking to. I think those who are ok with Havana are:- Tolerant with inefficient and inconsistent service. The staff range from awesome to need improvement, for example in terms of the amount of times a customer must repeat their order.- Ok with drinking diluted drinks. The only undiluted things are the shots and the wine.- Ok with / a love for dancing to 80s music in the upstairs dance area that could be more crowded than the KTM and Monorail during rush hour. At one point at the dance floor, we had to make a detour because of the sheer amount of people.- Are confident with handling creepy people on a regular basis, especially on the dance floor. One of the worst I know of is when a female friend got bitten and touched inappropriately at multiple areas of her body.

The roast pork was delicious except there were only 5 small slices. The salad was interestingly delicious with at least 10 ingredients that I could identify.The tempura vegetables came in a thick, crisp, hard batter with no resemblance to Japanese tempura.

Too much chicken meat/fish was used as filler.This is not acceptable for an establishment such as the Intercon. The price too were lower than before. The ""cheong fun"" selection was also not good, utilising ingredients such as dried shrimp. One would expect prawns and scallops cheong fun from the Intercon. I think that the management has tried to re price the timsum to be more ""affordable"". This is a wrong strategy. I dont think that patrons to the Intercon are price sensitive if the quality and service is reflected in the pricing. The service is however still of a very high standard.(To the GM of Intercon KL : Please look into my comments. It may be shared by many other patrons.

The Restaurant is a delight for vegetarians. The variety of North Indian and South Indian food is really great, specially the chat counter (offering a variety of Indian Savouries) which operates from 4 pm to 11pm. The prices are quite reasonable and we paid between RM 30 and 45 for a fulfilling lunch or dinner. Apart from having a disappointing experience at Spice of India (Indian Restaurant at KLCC Suria where we paid RM 100 for a dinner) on the very first day of our five days stay in Kualalumpur, we could not resist ourselves from eating at Sangeetha daily and never though of trying another place as this was very near to our hotel and remained open from early morning till 11 pm.The staff is good but the only problem is that all the waiters have a habit of huddling at the service counter most of the time even without any work and they don't try to look at the customers' table for any further requirement unless they are called for.

Been to the place for several times, with the last visit being at the end of 2016. Went there again last weekend, and I have to say that it is a big disappointment to the food choice. Several foods have been nominated out from the buffet line. They serve no more types of fried noodles, fritters (banana, ubi, etc). I did not find any lamb but only beef. They put roasted turkey as a replace but it just taste like an ordinary chicken. Taste wise, has also degraded though not for all foods. The Malays dishes still taste good but the desserts were kinda nightmare. The cheese cake taste like you are eating the butter. Red velvet thin cake is combined with pudding to become some kind of layer cakes. Pasta and shepherd pie taste real strange (like they have accidentally put some perfume into it). And the sushi were not fresh. Hot drinks were only served in a hot flask, and not being topped up. The best highlight of the buffet is only the range of free flow Baskin Robbin ice -creams (but they have taken out the cone). With the price getting increased, and the quality degrades, no wonder there were less visitors Not even quarterly full. It used to be almost full house at one time.

The management did not maintain the quality of the food. I suspect they may have chosen quantity over quality. We ordered 4 dishes to savour. Each dish may have its own distinctive taste and seasoning. However, the two words to describe it is 'Diluted and bland'. Peranakan food is known to be rich and savoury. It is not supposed to be palatably light. So, my partner and I could not reconcile with that the fact that this restaurant is voted no.1 for its Nonya food.

Not sure if lack of pork made the dim sim less cohesive and the har gow or crystal shrimp dumpling did not stick to its skin. Other shortcomings were glutinious rice was too sticky (and did not taste loh mai kai without sausage, mushroom and chicken) > we had porridge which was too thin the chicken feet too tiny and the fish ball really meeny. Mini chicken char siw pau was good but cheong fun was so soOverall the dim sim here did not meet my expectations and likely yours unless you are halal dim sim foodie. No complaint about service but it does take a while for the food to be served. If ever you are to trust any review, first check out the crowd and the queue. Here there is none, big restaurant but only 4 tables were filled on a Saturday ( not sure if this was due to weekend being on Friday). Tea costs Rm2.50 a pax and service tax 10% and govt tax 5%.If you are a discerning dim sim die hard esp the non halal (pork based) this is not what you seek, you may want to go upstairs and have the RM50 per pax international buffet.For those whom don t know what real dim sim taste like,do enjoy your dim sim - you won t know what you are missing.

They merely learn from one another and could be the blind leading the blind in this case. Food was just so so. I told the manager that the garnishes for some of the hot dishes were cold. He was surprised to hear my less than average appraisal when asked by default how things were going for us. Bet he was expecting the usual good response from the non discerning.

Why do you need so much sugar when the soup will be sweetened by the caramelized onion and beef stock/broth. It is the worse onion soup I have tasted. Then comes my squid ink seafood pasta and it cost RM$79 is I am not wrong. I looked at the pasta and realised that there is no squid ink and just dark grey colored pasta with seafood. I tried the pasta and seafood. The pasta is not cooked properly so it is hard and the seafood is tasteless and I guess they boiled the seafood. I called the server again and he told me that they ran out of squid ink and that is Aglio Olio but how come no one tell me...I was apparently very upset and I told the server to bring it back to cook longer for the pasta to be cooked and add cream sauce as it was tasteless.

We asked our hotel for a similar recommendation and they spoke very highly of Fat Cupid. We read lots of great comments on Trip Advisor (so we knew it wasn't going to be a local gem but just good Malay food) so were excited to go. What a mistake. The menu sounded lovely with 'recipes handed down through generations' etc. My husband ordered the Thai beef salad (which we have both eaten lots) and when it came to the table, it was a bowl of lettuce with some beef in and no dressing or flavour. I ordered the 'famous' wontons that were so over cooked, I needed the spicy sauce that came with it to take the burnt flavour away. At this point we were both a little unsure about eating our main and noticed that nearly everyone around us were eating paninis (they obviously knew something we didn't). We stuck it out and when our mains arrived I wish we hadn't. We both ordered the waitresses favourite dishes off the menu - chicken curry and a laksa. My husbands curry was edible but not tasty or delicious and my laksa was like eating a bowl of spicy hot water. There was no real flavour, no depth to the dish and even the prawn that I tried was bland. I did not eat this dish. As mentioned, we have tried these dishes in other parts of Malaysia as well as other countries and it has never tasted like this. We asked the waiter for a roti or something similar and he said our roti is square which we'd never heard of but ordered it - we had to laugh when he brought to the table two slices of brown bread!!!

But it was ridiculously-dry, not unlike an old dishwashing sponge. And to think one of the hosts who greeted me actually had the gall to proclaim that their desserts are excellent when I made it known that that was what I came for - the nerve, I tell you!The caffe mocha not only required close to 15 minutes to be served (I timed them), but when it came, it was one of the saddest, most-uninspired concoction I've ever come across (and I've eaten at several very shady, very questionable establishments). The liquid was tepid (I'm being generous - try plonk a thermometer in there and watch as nothing happens, I guarantee you). Serving coffee this terrible should be against the UN Convention Against Torture! For around RM15 per cup, you might as well cross the thoroughfare to Coffee Beans, harrumph.My goodness! All these glowing reviews are making me question my sanity, honestly. A friend highly recommended this place, which was why I stopped by; she's getting a horrid present this Christmas!Nice ambience, though, if a tad noisy (i.e. don't expect to be able to have a quiet conversation here). I enjoy the music selection well enough. Tables are quite packed; the back of my chair was flush against the edge of another patrons' table. Also, there's a constant gust of warm air from the counter - don't know what that's about.The staff were friendly and charming, but always in a hurry to get away from you. The first fellow ran off before I could finish my order; thankfully another guy saw me try to catch his attention as he was dashing off and this second one came to 'rescue' me. Same thing when I was trying to pay. Dropped the bill and off he went before I could even blink (I already had my purse out in preparation because it was a little hard getting their attention).

We ordered a chicken pancake appetizer, which was like chicken friend in a delicious breading, which was quite good. I then ordered the seafood pasta, and my friend ordered the chicken pasta, neither which were supposed to be spicy. After we ordered a table of girls sat down at a table nearby and ordered, and we were a bit put off when they got their meals much quicker than we did. One of the women had ordered the seafood pasta like I did, and complained about how spicy it was, which made me nervous. My friend and I spoke of maybe her idea of spicy is very mild, and agreed that if I couldn‚Äôt handle the spice in my pasta, we would switch plates. We began to get slightly annoyed with the wait, but then they brought our entrees out and apologized for the wait. My friend began to eat his dish and commented that it was spicy. Literally as soon as I put mine in my mouth I knew there was no way I could eat it. It was literally probably the hottest thing I‚Äôve ever put in my mouth. My friend saw my face and immediately took the plate and took a bite, and within seconds he agreed that it was insanely spicy, much spicier than the mild Thai food that we had, and we put it to the side to send it back. I‚Äôve never sent back a meal before, but I cannot even explain the level of spice in this dish, almost like someone put harbenaro sauce all over it. The waiter came back and we explained, and he said that he would bring back one without spice. A manager went to the table of the girls next to us and they complained to him, and even pointed at my friend and said, ‚Äúlook at how hot it was, he was even sweating!.‚Äù It turned out that they had borrowed a cook from another restaurant who did not cook it correctly. By this point my friend had even decided the chicken pasta was too spicy, and set it to the side. When they finally brought the seafood pasta out we were starving and very quickly shared it and left. The seafood pasta that was brought out without spice and very little flavor. For the wait time and time and the inconvenience of everything we wish some food would have been taken off of our bill.

I told the worker the drink does not taste like Lemongrass at all but he had an attitude (the one where hair cover his forehead, no offense but scruffy looking), he debated with me and said it is Lemongrass juice, so I asked have you had Lemongrass juice before? He grunted and brought my drink back to the counter and said loudly to the guy who did the drink, this is not Lemongrass (sarcastically).He brought it back, I tasted it there was no difference. I left the whole thing untouched. Like I said Lime Juice. The nasi lemak was terrible, the chicken was so dry and tough. The sotong sambal was okay.I like the caramelized chicken (I think it's chicken), this tasted the best among all the dishes. When we paid the bill, a chinese man was nice, he said probably there is too much lime in the drink so I can't taste the lemongrass, and how come we didn't eat the petai, I replied we don't eat petai and he said we can ask for no petai.

It was packed at dinner time and everyone was engaged in animated banter. The crowd was young and lively. It lifted the spirits! The second thing is the multi-racial crowd - in fact I saw more non Indians than Indians that night, which says a lot about its appeal to a broad cross-section of Malaysians and expats. And third was the reception we received from Chef-owner Yogesh personally as we walked into the restaurant. With a broad smile and warm handshake he greeted us as if we were old friends. He in fact did the same for all guests and I noticed he was walking the floor the whole night, talking to guests and getting feedback on the food. With such active engagement it‚Äôs not surprising the experience is bound to make a lasting impression on anyone who visits this restaurant. We ordered starters, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, which were all very good. What struck me most was the way they were served, neatly carved bite-sized pieces on wooden trays, reminiscent of Spanish Tapas. The main course consisted of dhal, brinjals, ladies fingers and the piece-de-resistance, the lamb briyani. The briyani, prepared in the ‚Äúdum‚Äù style of cooking which originated from Hyderabad, is traditionally cooked in sealed earthen pots to retain its juices and flavour. Hyderabad briyani is renowned in India. So it was not surprising when I later learnt that the briyani at this restaurant is highly popular and could arguably be the best in KL. We rounded up the meal with ‚Äúkulfi‚Äù (Indian style ice cream) which was not sweet enough and didn‚Äôt quite make an impression on us. Also the portion, served in a large metal container, was rather large for one person after a big meal. Overall it was a memorable experience. Kudos to Chef Yogesh for giving a refreshing twist to North Indian cuisine. I see good potential for this concept to spread its wings beyond its base in the upscale neighbourhood of Damansara Heights.I would highly recommend a branch in KLCC or Pavillion mall which deserve to have an innovative North Indian restaurant like this, appealing to a wider audience.

6461161008,sylvietsh,Instagrammable restaurant - most likely for a group of friends if you're looking for something different,"A very colourful and inviting restaurant that's tucked away on Jalan Kamunting. It's best if you book in advance due to MCO restrictions so it can be hard to get a table if you just walk in. It's not very big as well but there is good air flow if ventilation is a concern during these pandemic times. The flavours of the food were great. We had the pork carinatas and guava glazed prawns tostadas for starters, I especially loved the prawns. The jerk chicken with mango relish was delicious, the sauce can be quite spicy so be wary! The food was a little towards the warm side rather than hot, which I'd personally prefer. In terms of pricing, it can be on the less budget friendly side if this is your concern. Staff are friendly and provide helpful recommendations on what to order. Overall, a very ""instagramable"" place that I'd probably only visit for special occasions.

So delicious, in fact, that my friend couldn't bear to leave the melted puddle of ice-cream and sauce on her plate, and slurped it all up with a straw! My favourites here are the {mushroom, sour cream, cheese + extra onions} galette (or as they call them, salty pancakes) and the salted butter caramel crepe with a scoop (or two) of coconut ice-cream. Sometimes, with extra caramel. Divine! And the {caramel, nutella, ice-cream & strawberries} combo is positively sinful, but so good you really don't care!Also, above and beyond the crepes and galettes, the awesome service we receive from Soumia & Vincent (and their staff!) is always par excellence, no matter how busy their creperie is, or the time of the day. We once made a stop at MY French Factory for a last hurrah before getting on our evening flights, only to find out the caramel sauce had been sold out for the day. Instead of disappointing us, Soumia asked if we could wait 15 minutes, made more caramel sauce on the spot, and made VERY happy customers of all of us. THAT's what I call service, and business owners who really care about their customers! I'm a fan for life. :)As mentioned by a few reviewers, the creperie is indeed small. However, I'd recommend that you visit just as they open at noon, or between 3pm-6pm, when the crowds aren't at their peak, to avoid the seating issues. Also, if you happen to be driving, I recommend that you park at the Cenang Mall next door, or at the Baron Hotel's parking lot. Also as mentioned by a few others, the place isn't exactly somewhere you go for cheap eats.

In December, the restaurant apparently only serves a 'High on Sugar' afternoon tea. Alright, given the name, I was expecting a lot of delectable sweet and savoury dessert choices. But what was laid out was only a table, comprising of cakes, macarons, scones, pralines etc. Taste was mediocre but really nothing fantastic.The table served two choices of sandwiches - tuna and chicken, of which was a thick stack of bread with very little tuna or chicken filling. And the restaurant also served complimentary dim sum, spring rolls, and epok-epok (seriously?). I mean, how do these fit into the 'High on Sugar' theme?Food aside, my biggest qualm about the restaurant is its service. We came slightly early and was asked to wait at the lounge while they prepared our table and the service in general. 5 minutes into 3 pm and we were only ushered in a while later. Never mind that, but our table were not set properly, and comparing with the other tables, some things were missing. Probably worst, the buffet table was not ready, and the servers were still bringing the food and the utensils out 15-20 minutes into the supposed start of the tea time. Remember the sandwich? It wasn't brought out until 20 minutes later.And oh. One of the managers/supervisor came to ask if everything was okay. He asked ""Everything is alright, right?"" I'm quite sure he meant ""Is everything to your liking?"" And later on, some of the supervisors were discussing about a colleague, and I could clearly hear dissing/vulgarities.

We went there with a group of friends for dinner and decided to go for the chef's tasting menu to try the best that the restaurant could offer. However, half the dishes were disappointing to say the least.The starters were alright but nothing remarkable. It was after the carabinero that things started to go downhill. The prawn was not cleaned out at all and still had the strip of gut and faecal material running down the top which destroyed the experience for me. If a local hawker could clean and gut a prawn properly, I don't see why this can happen in an establishment like this. It is simply unacceptable.The chicken wing was dry and lacks flavour. Why chicken wing in a fine dining restaurant anyway? Then came the turbot which had a strong fishy odor that threw off the balance of the dish with an aftertaste which I would describe as unpleasant.We were hoping for the mains to redeem the night, but it ended up as a disappointment as well. Both the lamb and beef were tough and inedible. Worse still was the foie gras which had a strange odour which reminded me of stale fruits.Service was terrible as well. Gave feedback to the waiter regarding the uncleaned prawns but nothing was done, and they simply ignored the matter. Food was slow and it seemed like they are understaffed.Would we go again?

4164192284,Pamela C,no to impressed dissapointed,"We decided to have a little celebration for my dad's Birthday In June. We wanted a nice place to eat and celebrate his birthday. So decided on Strato thinking this would be a nice experience with the view and being an Italian restaurant. But My dad's feedback was not impressed with the serve and overly priced Italian food!!. Other then the location and ambience of the sky city view, I would just stop at that, the layout impressive and that is about it, there is nothing to shout about with the food being serve here. We were seated at the balcony because we wanted a nice city view, But nothing to shout about. The table setting was average, as it was an outdoor dining we would expect more lights at least more table candles for us to see the faces of person we are sitting next too and also to see what we are eating. I did on numerous times requested for the waiter to bring more table candles out. that fell on deaf ears. Just not attentive enough. This place is overly priced Italian food. I had better Italian dishes else where and even cooking at home taste better. The service provided was more or less average, it could be better with more attention to detail from their wait staff, They could be more equiped with the knowledge of their food menu. To start our dinning experience, we ordered the antipasti platter to share for 4 people, the menu did say 2-3 people serving I understand that. But when it arrived it was such a small serving, I would say this platter should be change on the menu for sharing of 1-2 person not 2-3. It was not generous at all with the items on the platter and it looked average Meh!!!, with small cuts of sourdough bread, we could not even fit the cured meat on top for it having it dropping off the side. We had to ask for more bread. Mind you this platter was RM$70.00 on the menu, it was not justified with the price and the serving. It was a ripped off. Then we had our mains, my dad wanted a nice piece of steak so he ordered the Pan seared rib eye steak, garlic ricotta, salsa verde & arugula at RM$95.00. Again we were disappointed when it arrived. We requested for the steak to be cook rare to medium. And having cutting the outer part of the meat it was okay, but as dad process to eat the steak to the centre of it, it became very tough to cut the steak. It was so dark you can't even see the inside of the meat. We had to use our Phone torchlight to inspect it, don't the kitchen use a Thermometer to check the meat!!!???. We expected a Medium-rare: A more pink colour with a little pink juice flowing. None of that it was RARE!! and still Blue. seriously at RM95.00 we would expect a good quality steak. Again here the price of what they served is not justified. We then complained to our waiter and his solution was to return the steak back on to the grill and recook it again. Seriously.... we were shocked !!! you don't just do that !!! you should serve us a proper cooked steak again as requested!! he stood there taking notes of the error and said to us that he will give this feedback to the chef, then he went on saying about the chef that he was trained in Italy for 1 month to cook and he was an experienced chef in cooking steak. And that was his way of dealing with our complain. Such a Rubbish....Our pasta and pizza arrived. Pasta: seriously bad it was dry with not enough crab meat and was not substantial at all it did not look inviting to eat. we had the Crab meat linguini, chili, rocket & garlic chips RM55.Pizza: we order the Modern margherita with buffalo mozarella & cherry tomatoes on the vine RM40.00. again not impressed at all. not enough ingredients, lack flavour and just not justified with the servings. I don't think the money was well spent here, for such a unsatisfied meal and having spend RM500.00 on a meal that night, we were very disappointed. Not a place I would return even if you are going for the view.",Reviewed 11 August 2016 ,Strato,KL,Italian

So we havd high expectations. We had reservations, but when we arrived, they seated us smack in the entrance ( close to the kitchen counter where waiters took the food trays rom). So we requested to be moved- they moved us to the ' extension"" which was outside- where we were promptly attacked by mosquitoes. So we moved back to the same table inside. Ordered drinks, and we could have sworn there was no alcohol in their bloody Mary. There wa sno difference between my drink and which my wife ordered ( she sked for non-alcoholic one, and I found it tasted exactly as mine, which was supposed to be a regular one). The service simply sucks .When we checked about their "" Special menu for the evening"", the waitress ( who was the perfect non-friendly, sour faced , disillusioned employee of the year) said she did not know if the items came with anything else such as rice or salad. Finally we ordered, and requested that my wife who is a vegetarian, be served a garlic bread or at least two slices of bread- and she refused saying there is no bread ( There is no Bread in a restaurant !!!) . We were about the first to arrive there ( 7: 10 PM), so there were not more than 3 patrons there, but the way the waiters ran around, talking loudly, made it look like the place was crouded and they were over stressed ! When the food came, it came in intervals of 15 minutes- so the first to get served had almost finished when I got my order ( the last). By then the restaurant was half full, so we waited another 15 minutes before we got the attention of the waitress, and asked for the bill and reuested for a taxi- she said there is no way she can call a cab, as they dont have any phone numbers for that ( even tiniest restaurants we dined in Kuching had no such problems). While waiting for the Check, another lady ( who looked and acted like the owner) asked us if evrything is OK. We all shrugged, and showed our disappointment, but she never asked any more questions and walked past. When we paid the check, the change came as a big bundle of singles ( about 25 of them, along with bigger bills), and with the waitress and another person (Owner??) hovering around, watching us count it all out, and checking out how much we would tip for their wonderful attitude and adding insult to injury ( pricy dinner for a lousy year end evening). For the first time in our life, we decided they deserved NO tip - for NOSH ( No Service Here restaurant). As I need to say something positive here, my food ( shank of lamb) was good, but my friends did not enjoy what they ordered.My recommendation- Avoid this place like plague, if you want to feel good about a meal !",Reviewed 5 January 2014 ,Mr Ho Fine Food,Kuching,Mexican

All that time waiting, they could at least prepare the rice and forks and spoons so we can eat readily but noooooo... Now for the food. It is not authentic at all. The pom tay was diluted. In actuality,the stew was suppose to boil with the potatoes for a while to the point the stew is thick and the potatoes super soft but this was far from it. Their prawn fritters, I think.. Even the local store by the road that sells 'cucur udang' actually tastes better. The otak otak was alright. The Tom yam was alright but they use very cheap cuts of meat for every dish. For the pom tay, they use chicken breast (with skills, you can make the breast soft but the meat was incredibly tough and dry) as for the Tom yam, there was very few fish meat and a lot more of fish cakes.

Tucked in a corner on the first floor, is the Busaba Heavenly Thai.Its amazing that they're still around amidst all the stiff competition. I guess delivering consistently good food deserves a loyal clientele, plus its conveniently discrete location helps.This time around, Heavenly Thai didn't disappoint...on both counts.They have erected a private room within the restaurant. Though it is still visibly present to others and audibly boisterous celebrations failed not to be noticed, it was all joyfully accepted by other diners as there was also a loud birthday celebration in the centre of the restaurant.The corporates, in line with current general economic malaise I suppose, were a lot subdued. They were still there, murmuring instead of chattering. And we decided not to have green curry.Four of us held back on the choices. Coming more for a change to our tastebuds, we had pandan chicken, kangkong belacan, steamed fish and topped it off with water chestnut and mango sticky rice combo for sweets. Run of the mill Thai fare.The place was packed. The furnishings and ambience of the place was most pleasant. The staff were most helpful and polite, befitting the Thai personna.

When we sat down they brought some prawn chips to the table without asking and they also tried to give us wet towels toward the end which we told them we did not need. When we got out bill there were charges for the towels and the chips. I do not go back to restaurants like this where they try to rip off the patrons, even if the food was good, but in this case the food was very poor quality. The omelette was so greasy we did not even eat more than one bite. The spring roll was also greasy and mushy. The rice was not fresh. The squid was overcooked, and the kang kong was fishy tasting (and yes we like fish sauce). The total bill for a bad lunch was 86.50 MYR.

It doesn't have a bar, but allows guests to bring in their own drinks, and demands no corkage! As for the food, it's a smorgasbord of colours, smells, tastes and flavours. I did have a couple of regrets - if only the establishment was big enough for its clientele!

The sticky rice mango dessert had a reasonable amount of mango and sticky rice. Once the food had been served, getting the attention of a waiter was difficult.

Drinks are coffee and plenty choices of tea such as jasmine, camomile, earl grey, peppermint etc. Free flow of beer and wine with some additional charge. Worth to pay if one wants a relaxing long dinner. I wasn't too happy that the dessert spread hasn't vast choices, and they sit in a counter, so the waiter picks them for you. So you can't just load your plates high! Anyhow looking so exclusive, unfortunately nothing catches my taste buds.It's a busy place with mixture of tourists, locals, families, couples and friends.
